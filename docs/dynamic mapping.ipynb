    "# Dynamic Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, data for creating maps are retrievable in regular intervals or available historically. In such cases, \n",
    "dynamic mapping can uncover additional insights beyond what static maps can offer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic mapping, however, is more challenging than simply creating a (static) market map at each point in time (see [[1]](#ref_1)).\n",
    "The dynamic mapping framework *EvoMap* provides one solution to this problem. *EvoMap* integrates various static mapping methods \n",
    "and allows the analyst to use them for creating dynamic market maps. Thereby, it provides the analyst with a high degree of control \n",
    "over its output (e.g., by letting the analyst set certain constraints on the resultant maps, such as the degree of smoothing). \n",
    "\n",
    "For methodological background and a detailed description, see the original paper [[1]](#ref_1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use *EvoMap* to create dynamic market maps from time-evolving relationship data. The tutorial covers data preparation, running the method, evaluating its results, tuning its hyperparameter and several useful functions provided as part of this package (e.g., for drawing dynamic market maps).  \n",
